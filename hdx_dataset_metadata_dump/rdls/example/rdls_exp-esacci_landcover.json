      "description": "This dataset provides global land cover maps at 300m spatial resolution describing the land surface into 22 classes defined using the UN FAO Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). The maps cover the period from 1992 to present with annual temporal resolution. The dataset includes land cover classification maps along with four quality flags documenting the reliability of the classification and change detection processes. These maps are produced using a baseline classification approach applied to the MERIS Full and Reduced Resolution archive (2003-2012), which is then back-dated and updated using AVHRR (1992-1999), SPOT-VGT (1998-2012), PROBA-V (2013-2019), and Sentinel-3 OLCI/SLSTR (2020-present) time series. The maps for 2016-2022 are consistent with the ESA CCI global annual land cover maps from 1992-2015, ensuring temporal continuity across the entire time series.",

      "version": "2.1.1",
      "purpose": "This dataset is designed primarily to support climate modeling communities by providing long-term, temporally consistent land cover information as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV). The comprehensive legend spanning global-scale landscape diversity makes it valuable for various applications including climate modeling, land accounting, forest monitoring, desertification studies, and scientific research. The dataset addresses user requirements for global coverage, multi-decadal temporal extent with yearly updates, thematic detail compatible with Plant Functional Types (PFTs) used in climate models, and transparent quality assessment through independent validation.",

      "details": "The land cover maps are delivered in NetCDF-4 format following CF-1.6 conventions, with a geographic coordinate system based on WGS84 using Plate Carrée projection. Each annual map includes five bands: lccs_class (land cover classification), processed_flag (processing status), current_pixel_state (pixel state during baseline generation), observation_count (number of valid observations), and change_count (number of detected land cover changes during 1992-2022). The change detection methodology captures transitions between six IPCC land categories (cropland, forest, grassland, wetland, settlement, and other land), with changes requiring confirmation over at least two consecutive years. The dataset achieves an overall accuracy of approximately 70% when validated against independent reference samples. Four land cover classes rely on external datasets: tree cover flooded saline water (mangroves from global atlas), urban areas (Global Human Settlement Layer and Global Urban Footprint), water bodies (CCI global open water bodies map), and permanent snow and ice (Randolph Glaciers Inventory). The spatial resolution corresponds to 0.002778° (approximately 300m at the equator, ~200m in mid-latitudes). File sizes are approximately 2.5 GB per annual map with internal LZW compression.",
